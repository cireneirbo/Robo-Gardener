# Robo-Gardener
Water your plants with robots! How to build an automatic watering system with an Arduino.

## Welcome Viewer!
Greetings! Are you looking for a cool way to water all of your plants or crops without having to lift a finger? Then you're in luck - for the Robo-Gardener is here! It blends automation and simple robotics with argriculture in an attempt to build a greener and brighter future! 

### Some Notes
* This project will aims to be written in a way that should be easy for any non-GitHub/non-programmer person to use. 
* If you are confused about anything in the directions, or how to get a working version of the Robo-Gardener in your backyard/garden/home/etc. then please reach out to me by email! `ericobrien89@gmail.com` 
* I did not create this project, but tried to make it more user friendly. The original posting of it comes from https://www.instructables.com/Automatic-Garden-Watering-Device-Arduino/
* My goal for listing this is to get as many of these out there in the world as possible. Together, we can build a solarpunk future! :)
